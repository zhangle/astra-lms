The Astra LMS project was born from the author's need to implement a simple LMS to obtain a Bachelor Degree in Information Systems.

At first only a few features will be added to the system:
  * User management
  * Simple Course management
  * SCORM 2004 3rd Edition support
  * A system-wide widget system

Astra is written on top of Ruby on Rails.
